Issues I Ran Into:

1. First major problem I had to figure out was the enumeration and how that worked. At first I tried to do an enumeration with 
strings rather than making an enumeration with variable names for their number placeholder. I went to office hours on 3/12 in the
morning to ask a question on this. Once I noticed that the enumeration was actually supposed to be used for indexing an array of
constant strings it made much more sense.

2. Second major problem I had to figure out was printing the final temp node. For a while my print functions would only print to the
second to last node because I had the loop set to (if (temp->next != NULL) temp = temp->next;) which ignores the last node. This is
the syntax I would use if I was adding a node to the list, but when printing you want to include the final node so temp->next in the if
statement should if (if (temp != NULL)).

3. Third major problem was trying to do the extra credit 2 portion. I ended up having to close the file after each time I called a print
and reopened it with the next cycle in the loop (assuming the user enters a valid number). Before this I just tried closing the file at the end
of the loop but that did not give expected output.
